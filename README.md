l3-tasks
==================

This repo contains some generic tasks I use to develop laravel3 applications.

Usage
-----

clone or use as git submodule in application/tasks of your laravel3 installation. the autoloader should load the tasks.
keep in mind that laravel3 does not support tasks in subfolders.
